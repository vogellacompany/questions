questions:
  - description: Can commits get lost in Git?
    choices:
      - Yes, if it is not reachable from any branch or reference
      - No, commits do not get lost with Git, at least for a while. Commit which cannot be reached from other references (commits, tags, branches, etc) will eventually be removed by a garbage collector run after multiple weeks.
      - Yes, if you create an unreferenced commit by committing with a detached head
      - Yes, after using the 'git amend' or 'git reset' commands
    hint: 
    explanation: Commit are never removed within a longer timeframe. To find 'lost' commits, use the reflog functionality

  - description: What is meant with the 'Detached HEAD state'
    choices:
      - It is when Git doesnt know which is the latest commit of a repository
      - It is when Git lost track of your repository
      - It is when you checkout a branch and do not create a new local branch for it
      - It is when the connection to the repository is interupted

    correctChoice: 2
  - description: What is the stash?
    choices:
      - It is a separate area where changes can be put if they are not yet ready to be commited
      - It is where all deleted files end up
      - It is where the staged changes are collected
      - It is where the unstaged changes are collected
    hint: 
    explanation: Committing to the stash does not create a new commit but instead saves all staged and unstaged changes in a new stash.
    correctChoice: 0
  - description: When is it common to use the stash?
    choices:
      - Everytime before a commit and push of changes
      - When merge or rebase is executed, but the local uncommitted changes should not get lost and are not quite ready to be commited on the current branch
      - If files are to be deleted
      - If a new commit should replace an older commit
    hint: 
    explanation: 
    correctChoice: 1
  - description: In which scenario is it recommended to use the 'git filter-branch'?
    choices:
      - If you only want to clone certain branches of the repository
      - If you want to change the commit history, for example to remove a large file or a file which contains a password from the Git history
      - Everytime you want to remove files from a specific branch.
      - 
    hint: 
    explanation: Using the filter-branch command is dangerous as it changes the Git repository. It changes the commit IDs and reacting on such a change requires explicit action from the developer, e.g., trying to rebase the stale local branch onto the corresponding rewritten remote-tracking branch.
