  - description: What is the difference btw. merge and rebase?
    choices:
      - There is no difference at all as the working tree looks the same
      - The final result for the source code is the same, but the rebase operation moves the changes onto another commit as if these changes started from this commit
      - With rebase git solves all merge conficts itself
      - Using rebase should be avoided as you lose the information how the branches was integrated
    hint: Same but different.
    explanation: Rebase moves the work done in one branch or commit onto the changes done in another branch. This results in less merge commits and a linear history.

  - description: What is the cherry-pick command used for?
    choices:
      - To select individual changes created by commits and apply the same changes onto another commit
      - To select the commit with the best description
      - To delete wrong commits
      - 
    hint: Just get the best of a branch
    explanation: The git cherry-pick command allows you to select the changes which was introduced with an individual commit and apply these changes on another branch. This is captured as a new commit on the other branch.
