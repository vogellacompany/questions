    choices:
      - A feature project defines the software features which our users need

      - The product defines the features and is used only to start the application via the IDE. 
      - The product defines the plug-ins (potentially via features) and additional configuration and is used for the start and export of the application. 
      - At runtime the product configuration is read and used to start the application. 
      - 
    hint: 
    explanation: The product is not used at runtime, its configuration is used to define the plug-ins available during runtime and the configuration.
