name: Introduction to Eclipse plug-in development
questions:
  - description: What is the purpose of a target platform?
    choices:
      - It defines the project target which should be developed
      - It defines the available plug-in to compile your software tests code
      - It defines the available plug-ins for development, i.e. for compiling, feature and product definition
      - It defines the server API which is accessed by the application
    hint: 
    explanation: The target definition file contains the plug-in which can be used in your Eclipse application.
    correctChoice: 2
  - description: Using a target platform definition file should be preferred because
    choices:
      - It decouples your IDE from your code base and can be re-used for your command line build with Maven Tycho.
      - It can be used from the command line build and you can still use the latest API from your IDE installation in your application.
      - It allows you to commit the documentation file to your version control system
      - 
    hint:
    explanation: A target platform definition file can be used to configure the plug-in available to develop against in your IDE and be used for your command line build.
    correctChoice: 0
  - description: What is the purpose of a feature project in Eclipse?
    choices:
      - A feature project defines the software features which our users need
      - A feature project groups plug-ins and other feature to a unit which can be used by the product configuration file.
      - A feature project is used to define the runtime configuration for Eclipse applications 
      - 
    hint: 
    explanation: Features allow to group plug-in and to include other features to use them in the product. This makes it easier to manage the content of your product
    correctChoice: 1
  - description: What is the purpose of the product configuration file?
    choices:
      - The product defines the features and is used only to start the application via the IDE. 
      - The product defines the plug-ins (potentially via features) and additional configuration and is used for the start and export of the application. 
      - At runtime the product configuration is read and used to start the application. 
      - 
    hint: 
    explanation: The product is not used at runtime, its configuration is used to define the plug-ins available during runtime and the configuration. 
    correctChoice: 1
  - description: What is the main purpose of an Eclipse plug-in?
    choices:
      - To create a new Java project in Eclipse
      - To encapsulate and modularize functionality for Eclipse-based applications
      - To define how the user interface of the application should look like
      - To configure the runtime environment of Eclipse applications
    hint: Think in terms of modular architecture.
    explanation: Plug-ins are the building blocks of Eclipse applications and allow for modular development by encapsulating specific functionality.
    correctChoice: 1
  - description: Which file must exist in every Eclipse plug-in project?
    choices:
      - plugin.xml
      - MANIFEST.MF
      - .project
      - build.gradle
      - pom.xml
    hint: This file contains metadata about the plug-in, such as its dependencies.
    explanation: The `MANIFEST.MF` file defines essential metadata like plug-in ID, version, and dependencies. It is mandatory in every Eclipse plug-in.
    correctChoice: 1
  - description: What is a key benefit of modularizing your application using plug-ins?
    choices:
      - It improves rendering performance of the UI
      - It reduces the size of the JRE required to run the app
      - It increases test coverage automatically
      - It allows separation of concerns and easier maintenance
    hint: Think of software engineering principles.
    explanation: Modularizing using plug-ins supports separation of concerns, reuse, and maintainability of large applications.
    correctChoice: 3
  - description: What is the relationship between features and plug-ins?
    choices:
      - Plug-ins contain features and define their behavior
      - Features and plug-ins are unrelated concepts in Eclipse RCP
      - Features are used to group plug-ins and can include other features
      - Plug-ins can only be used inside features at runtime
    hint: Features are used to bundle functionality.
    explanation: Features act as containers that group multiple plug-ins and can be used to include them in a product configuration.
