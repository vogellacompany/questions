questions:
  - description: OSGi stands for... 
    choices:
      - OSGi, it is not a abbreviation.
      - Open Service Gateway interface
      - Open Service Gateway initiative
      - Open Service Guarded  
      -
    hint: 
    explanation: OSGi was originally the abbreviation for Open Service Gateway initiative but as the scope of OSGi broaded so these days OSGi stands only for OSGi.
    correctChoice: 0
  - description: OSGi is
    choices:
      - a specification for a module and service layer
      - an implementation for a module and service layer
      - 
      - 
    hint:
    explanation: The OSGi core specification specifies a module and service layer
    correctChoice: 0
  - description: What is a bundle in OSGi?
    choices:
     - A Java class 
     - A Java package 
     - A Java archive file
     - A Java module / project with additional metadata
    correctChoice: 3
  - description: What is the main purpose for the OSGi module layer?
    choices:
      - It allows to integrate with the Java 9 module layer
      - It allows to define versionized dependencies of a plug-ins to other plug-in or Java packages and to define the exported API of a plug-in 
      - It allows to use multi plug-in builds similar to multi-module builds with Maven
      - 
    hint: 
    explanation: The OSGi module layer allows to define versionized dependencies to other Java packages and plug-ins as well to define the API of plug-in, i.e. the packages which can be accessed from other plug-ins 
    correctChoice: 1
  - description: What is the main purpose for the OSGi service layer?
    choices:
      - The OSGi service layer allows to use dependency injection via @Inject
      - The OSGi service layer allows to define the usage of OSGI services in e4 components.
      - The OSGi service layer allows to define OSGI services and immediate components which can be consumed by other OSGi services and via the Eclipse dependency injection mechanisms.
      - 
    hint: 
    explanation: The OSGi service layer allows to define OSGI services and immediate components which can be consumed via in other code without knowing the concrete implementation.
    correctChoice: 2
  - description: OSGi services
    choices:
      - are based on JSR 330 which defines dependency injection for Java applications.
      - can be defined via compile-time annotations which Eclipse can use to generated the required meta-data for the OSGi runtime 
      - can be defined via runtime-time annotations which Eclipse uses to provide the required meta-data for the OSGi runtime 
      - 
    hint: 
    explanation: The OSGi declarative service functionality allows to use compile-time annotations which the Eclipse IDE can use to generate the required meta-data which OSGI uses at runtime to provide the services.
    correctChoice: 1
  - description: How are OSGi services typically registered and consumed?
    choices:
      - Services are manually registered and looked up via the ServiceRegistry API
      - Services are injected using @Inject in combination with a static service locator
      - Services are registered and consumed using declarative services (DS) and annotations like @Component and @Reference
      - 
    hint: Consider how DS and annotations simplify service management.
    explanation: Declarative Services (DS) allow automatic registration and injection of services using annotations like @Component and @Reference.
    correctChoice: 2
  - description: Which annotation is used to declare a class as an OSGi service component?
    choices:
      - "@Service"
      - "@Injectable"
      - \@Component
      - \@Bean
    hint: This annotation comes from the org.osgi.service.component.annotations package.
    explanation: \@Component is the annotation used to declare an OSGi Declarative Service component.
    correctChoice: 2
  - description: What is the purpose of the @Reference annotation in OSGi Declarative Services?
    choices:
      - To inject a service from another bundle into a field or method
      - To declare a logging service to be used in your plug-in
      - To define the bundle manifest headers for service wiring
      - 
    hint: It's used to express a dependency.
    explanation: The \@Reference annotation defines a dependency on another OSGi service, which the framework will resolve and inject automatically.
    correctChoice: 0
  - description: What happens if a required \@Reference service is not available at runtime?
    choices:
      - The component is activated with a null reference
      - The component is not activated
      - The OSGi runtime throws a compile-time error
      - 
    hint: Think of lifecycle management in DS.
    explanation: If a required service is missing, the Declarative Services runtime will not activate the component.
